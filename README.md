# EducationalAttainment
This project details an analysis of educational attainment analysis for North Carolina Public Schools by investigating leading factors that contributed to graduation rates for high school students at 470 public schools in NC using a random forest model. Created for MSDS 7331: Data Mining by Noelle Brown, John Heinen, Lizzy Sterling, and Matt Rega.

* Language used: Python

## Results
We discovered that the number of suspensions and the daily attendance rate are among the top factors that lead to on-time graduation rates.
